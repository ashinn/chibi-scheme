** DONE ast rewrite
   - State "DONE"       [2009-04-09 Thu 14:32]
** DONE call/cc support
   - State "DONE"       [2009-04-09 Thu 14:36]
** DONE exceptions
   - State "DONE"       [2009-04-09 Thu 14:45]
** TODO native x86 backend
   API redesign in preparation complete, initial
   tests on native factorial and closures working.
** TODO fasl/image files
   sexp_copy_context() can form the basis for images,
   FASL for arbitrary modules will need additional
   help with resolving external references.
*** DONE optional image loading on startup
    - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2011-11-10 Thu 20:44]
*** TODO static image compiled into library
    With this you'll be able to run Chibi without any filesystem.
*** TODO external tool to compact and optimize images
    The current GC is mark&sweep, which can cause fragmentation,
    but we can at at least compact the initial fixed image.
*** TODO fasl versions of modules
    Important for large applications, and fast loading of script
    with many dependencies.
** DONE shared stack on EVAL
   - State "DONE"       [2009-12-26 Sat 08:22]

* compiler optimizations
** DONE constant folding
   - State "DONE"       [2009-12-16 Wed 23:25]
** DONE simplification pass, dead-code elimination
   - State "DONE"       [2009-12-18 Fri 14:14]
   This is important in particular for the output generated by
   syntax-rules.
** TODO lambda lift
   The current closure representation is not very efficient, so this
   would help a lot.
** TODO inlining (and disabling primitive inlining)
   Being able to redefine procedures is important though.
** TODO unsafe operations
   Possibly, don't want to make things too complicated or unstable.
** TODO plugin infrastructure
** DONE type inference with warnings
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2010-09-21 Tue 23:18]

   - State "DONE"       [2009-07-07 Tue 14:42]
** DONE unicode
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2010-07-11 Sun 23:58]
   Supported with UTF-8 strings, string-ref is O(n) and
   string-set! may need to reallocate the whole string.
   string-cursor-ref can be used for O(1) string access.
** DONE threads
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2010-07-11 Sun 15:31]
   VM now supports an optional hook for green threads,
   and a SRFI-18 interface is provided as a separate module.
   I/O operations will currently block all threads though,
   this needs to be addressed.
*** DONE thread-local parameters
    CLOSED: [2010-12-06 Mon 21:52]

** DONE virtual ports
   - State "DONE"       [2010-01-02 Sat 20:12]
