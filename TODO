** TODO native x86 backend
** TODO fasl/image files
** TODO shared stack on EVAL
   Arguably a bug, at the moment we create a new stack on every EVAL
   (which includes every macro definition, and in particular every
   call to let-syntax that a macro may expand into - I'm looking at
   you, (chibi loop)).

   This is important in particular for the output generated by
   syntax-rules.
** TODO lambda lift
   The current closure representation is not very efficient, so this
   would help a lot.
** TODO inlining (and disabling primitive inlining)
   Being able to redefine procedures is important though.

   Possibly, don't want to make things too complicated or unstable.
