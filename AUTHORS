Alex Shinn wrote the initial version of chibi-scheme and all
distributed modules.

The `dynamic-wind' implementation is adapted from the implementation
in the appendix to the Scheme48 reference manual, reportedly first
written by Chris Hanson and John Lamping.

The (scheme time) module includes code for handling leap seconds
from Alan Watson's Scheme clock library at
http://code.google.com/p/scheme-clock/ under the same license.

The benchmarks are based on the Racket versions of the classic
Gabriel benchmarks from
http://www.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/benchmarks-20100126/log3/index.html.
They are not installed or needed but are included for convenience.
