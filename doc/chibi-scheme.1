.SH DESCRIPTION
.I chibi-scheme
is a sample interactive Scheme interpreter for the
.I chibi-scheme
library.  It serves as an example of how to embed
.I chibi-scheme
in applications, and can be useful on its own for writing
scripts and interactive development.

When
.I script
is given, the script will be loaded with SRFI-22 semantics,
calling the procedure
.I main
(if defined) with a single parameter as a list of the
command-line arguments beginning with the script name.

Otherwise, if no script is given and no -e or -p options
are given an interactive repl is entered, reading, evaluating,
then printing expressions until EOF is reached.  The repl
provided is very minimal - if you want readline
completion you may want to wrap it with the
.I rlwrap(1)
program.  Signals aren't caught either - to enable handling keyboard
interrupts you can use the (chibi process) module.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP 5
.BI -V
Prints the version information and exits.
.TP
.BI -q
Don't load the initialization file.  The resulting
environment will only contain the core syntactic forms
and primitives coded in C.
.TP
.BI -f
Change the reader to case-fold symbols as in R5RS.
.TP
.BI -h size[/max_size]
Specifies the initial size of the heap, in bytes,
optionally followed by the maximum size the heap can
grow to.
.I size
can be any integer value, optionally suffixed by
"K", for kilobytes, "M" for megabytes, or "G" for gigabytes.
.I -h
must be specified before any options which load or
evaluate Scheme code.
.TP
.BI -I path
Inserts
.I path
on front of the load path list.  
.TP
.BI -A path
Appends
.I path
to the load path list.  
.TP
.BI -m module
Imports
.I module
as though "(import
.I module
)" were evaluated.  However, to reduce the need for shell
escapes, modules are written in a dot notation, so that the module
.I (foo bar)
is written as
.I foo.bar
.TP
.BI -l file
Loads the Scheme source from the file
.I file
searched for in the default load path.
.TP
.BI -e expr
Evaluates the Scheme expression
.I expr.
.TP
.BI -p expr
Evaluates the Scheme expression
.I expr
then prints the result to stdout.
.TP
.BI -d image-file
Dumps the current Scheme heap to
.I image-file
and exits.  This feature is still experimental.
.TP
.BI -i image-file
Loads the Scheme heap from
.I image-file
instead of compiling the init file on the fly.
This feature is still experimental.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B CHIBI_MODULE_PATH
.TQ
A colon separated list of directories to search for module
files, inserted before the system default load paths.
