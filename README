    Minimal Scheme Implementation for use as an Extension Language

              http://synthcode.com/wiki/chibi-scheme/

Chibi-Scheme is a very small library intended for use as an extension
and scripting language in C programs.  In addition to support for
lightweight VM-based threads, each VM itself runs in an isolated heap
allowing multiple VMs to run simultaneously in different OS threads.

The default language is R7RS Scheme with support for additional
languages such as JavaScript to be provided in future releases.
Scheme is chosen as a substrate because its first class continuations
and guaranteed tail-call optimization makes implementing other
languages easy.

To build on most platforms just run "make && make test".  This will
provide a shared library "libchibi-scheme", as well as a sample
"chibi-scheme" command-line repl.  You can then run

  sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local install

to install the binaries, leaving out the PREFIX for the default
/usr/local or specifying an alternate install location.  If you want
to try out chibi-scheme without installing, be sure to set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH so it can find the shared libraries.

For more detailed documentation, run "make doc" and see the generated
"doc/chibi.html".
