Chibi-Scheme is a very small but mostly complete R5RS Scheme
implementation using a reasonably fast custom VM.  Chibi-Scheme tries
as much as possible not to trade its small size by cutting corners,
and provides full continuations, both low and high-level hygienic
macros based on syntactic-closures, and string ports and exceptions.
Chibi-Scheme is written in highly portable C and supports multiple
simultaneous VM instances to run.

To build, just run "make".  You can edit the file config.h for a
number of settings, mostly disabling features to make the executable
smaller.  Documents and examples for using Chibi-Scheme as a library
for extension scripting will be provided in an upcoming release.

syntax-rules must be loaded manually from the file syntax-rules.scm.
