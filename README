    Minimal Scheme Implementation for use as an Extension Language

              http://synthcode.com/wiki/chibi-scheme/

Chibi-Scheme is a very small library intended for use as an extension
and scripting language in C programs.  In addition to support for
lightweight VM-based threads, each VM itself runs in an isolated heap
allowing multiple VMs to run simultaneously in different OS threads.

The default language is the R7RS (scheme base) library.

Support for additional languages such as JavaScript, Go, Lua and Bash
are planned for future releases.  Scheme is chosen as a substrate
because its first class continuations and guaranteed tail-call
optimization makes implementing other languages easy.

To build on most platforms just run "make && make test".  This will
provide a shared library "libchibi-scheme", as well as a sample
"chibi-scheme" command-line repl.  You can then run

  sudo make install

to install the binaries and libraries.  You can optionally specify a
PREFIX for the installation directory:

  make PREFIX=/path/to/install/
  sudo make PREFIX=/path/to/install/ install

By default files are installed in /usr/local.

If you want to try out chibi-scheme without installing, be sure to set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH so it can find the shared libraries.

For more detailed documentation, run "make doc" and see the generated
"doc/chibi.html".
