    Minimal Scheme Implementation for use as an Extension Language

              http://synthcode.com/wiki/chibi-scheme/

Chibi-Scheme is a very small library intended for use as an extension
and scripting language in C programs.  In addition to support for
lightweight VM-based threads, each VM itself runs in an isolated heap
allowing multiple VMs to run simultaneously in different OS threads.

The default language is based on an extended subset of the current
draft R7RS Scheme, with support for all libraries.  To get a pure R7RS
repl you can run

  chibi-scheme -xscheme.base

or see the (chibi repl) library for more options.

Support for additional languages such as JavaScript, Go, Lua and Bash
are planned for future releases.  Scheme is chosen as a substrate
because its first class continuations and guaranteed tail-call
optimization makes implementing other languages easy.

To build on most platforms just run "make && make test".  This will
provide a shared library "libchibi-scheme", as well as a sample
"chibi-scheme" command-line repl.  You can then run

  sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local install

to install the binaries, leaving out the PREFIX for the default
/usr/local or specifying an alternate install location.  If you want
to try out chibi-scheme without installing, be sure to set
LD_LIBRARY_PATH so it can find the shared libraries.

For more detailed documentation, run "make doc" and see the generated
"doc/chibi.html".
